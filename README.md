# CBZ creator

A utility to create CBZ files from a bunch of folders containing images (like the one you obtain when downloading mangas using [HakuNeko](https://hakuneko.download/))

Usage:

```
CbzCreator -i InputPath -o OutputPath -t Title
```

Where:

- `InputPath` is the path containing the folders to convert to CBZ
- `OutputPath` is the path where the CBZ files will be created to
- `Title` is the manga title (this will be used as file prefix)
